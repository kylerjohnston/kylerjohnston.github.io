        <p>For the last semester, I’ve been working as a research assistant for <a href="http://tedunderwood.com">Ted Underwood</a> on a project aiming to model one form of literary prestige.<sup id="fnref:novel"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:novel" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This is part of a larger project Ted has been working on along with another research assistant, Jordan Sellers. In a <a href="http://tedunderwood.com/2015/05/18/how-quickly-do-literary-standards-change/">blog post from May last year</a> (and a forthcoming article in <em>MLQ</em>), Ted and Jordan ran a model on two samples of 19th-century poetry&mdash;one a sample of works which had been reviewed in prominent literary magazines, and one a sample of works randomly selected from the <a href="http://hathitrust.org">HathiTrust Digital Library</a>&mdash;to see if the prestige of the reviewed volumes would be evident in the texts of the works themselves (spoiler: it is).</p>
<p>I’ve been working with Ted to construct a model that would predict whether or not a work of fiction would be a bestseller in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Andrew Piper has been doing <a href="http://txtlab.org/?p=596">similar</a> <a href="http://txtlab.org/?p=608">work</a> at McGill University. Is “bestsellerliness” a purely social feature, or something we can identify in a text? How stable are the textual features that predict bestsellerliness over time? Can the same features that predict bestsellerliness in 1840 predict bestsellerliness in 1900 and 1960?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we first needed to build a sample of bestselling works of fiction in America from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For information on twentieth-century bestsellers, we relied on John Unsworth’s <a href="http://unsworth.unet.brandeis.edu/courses/bestsellers/">20th-Century American Bestsellers database</a>. While Unsworth gives us clean lists of the top ten bestsellers by year in the twentieth century, information on nineteenth-century bestsellers is less comprehensive. I drew from a list of works compiled by Jordan, who had selected titles based on their inclusion in bibliographies by Richard Altick, Q. D. Leavis, and Alice Payne Hackett.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Hackett notes that for works published before 1895, data on total sales is scarce and unreliable, not only because the systematic recording of bestsellers had not yet begun but also because each book was issued by several publishers, many no longer in existence and with inaccurate or incomplete sales records (Hackett 221).<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> As such, pre-1895 bestsellers are not rigorously defined, nor is it possible to compile a &ldquo;top ten&rdquo; per year. Rather, we get a sampling of works published across the century which were known to have sold well. Leavis chooses works which are &ldquo;representative of the popular fiction&rdquo; of their time (331). Hackett identifies pre-1895 bestsellers as works &ldquo;which have without question sold a total of a million copies or more through the years&rdquo; (221).  In sum, we need to bear in mind that our nineteenth-century sample is less comprehensive than our twentieth-century sample and that it represents a sample of well-known, popular works more than a sample of bestsellers.</p>
<p>We sampled bestsellers from two databases of texts: the HathiTrust Digital Library and <a href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/literarynetworks/">the Chicago Text Lab</a>. For each bestseller, we also sampled a random volume from the same database, published in the same year, by an author who did not appear anywhere on our bestseller list. All together we sampled 1316 works of fiction from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p>
<p>Modeling this sample we get the following plot:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1. HathiTrust and Chicago Text Lab samples, 1800&amp;ndash;1990" src="http://kylerjohnston.com/static/img/model-2-1.png" /></p>
<p>In the plot above, the y-axis represents the probability that a work is a bestseller. Actual bestsellers are plotted in red dots; randomly sampled works are grey +s.</p>
<p>There are a couple interesting things going on in this plot. First of all, we see that our model is particularly good at predicting the bestsellerliness of works from the first half of the twentieth century. We also see a significant upward trend in bestsellerliness across both centuries. This seems to suggest not only that at least some of the same textual qualities that can predict whether or not something will be a bestseller in the early nineteenth century can also predict whether or not something will be a bestseller in the twentieth century, but that, over time, these features become more common in fiction. This could be evidence for a kind of literary natural selection.</p>
<p>We have to interpret this plot cautiously, though. There are some important differences in the datasets the works we&rsquo;re modeling come from that complicate our results. We relied on HathiTrust for our nineteenth-century works and the Chicago Text Lab for our twentieth-century works. HathiTrust has a wide range of texts, ranging from the very popular to the <em>very</em> obscure. Chicago has fewer obscure works&mdash;most things in Chicago, while not necessarily bestsellers, sold well enough. The trend we are seeing in this plot, then, is most likely a difference in the obscurity of texts we&rsquo;re modeling in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: our twentieth century sample contains fewer obscure, more popular texts.</p>
<p>To test this interpretation, I modeled the Chicago Text Lab texts on their own:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2. Chicago Text Lab sample, 1898&amp;ndash;1990" src="http://kylerjohnston.com/static/img/chicago_only_whole_20thc.png" /></p>
<p>When we model only works drawn from the Chicago Text Lab, we see a <em>reverse trend</em> from what we saw in our whole model. Over the course of the twentieth century, works tend to contain <em>fewer</em> of the features that would mark them as bestsellers. This is weird stuff! It suggests a definite stylistic shift over the course of the twentieth century; what&rsquo;s popular in 1990 would not have been as popular in 1900.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3. Chicago Text Lab sample, 1898&amp;ndash;1949" src="http://kylerjohnston.com/static/img/chicago1900-1949.png" /></p>
<p>If we break our model down into smaller, half-century segments, we can still see the downward trend continuing over the first half of the twentieth century. (Also interestingly, the model seems to be better at predicting bestsellerliness after about 1920.)</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4. Chicago Text Lab sample, 1950&amp;ndash;1990" src="http://kylerjohnston.com/static/img/chicago1950-1990.png" /></p>
<p>The trend flattens out over the latter half of the twentieth century, however. Whatever stylistic shifts were happening in the twentieth century, by 1950 they were mostly complete and things had mostly stabilized again. </p>
<p>What does this all represent in terms of literary history? My initial hunch was that we were seeing modernism&rsquo;s (and post-modernism&rsquo;s) break with Victorian, Edwardian, or Naturalist style. With the exception of (a very small) handful of Woolf, Hemingway, and Nabokov novels, though, our dataset of popular literature remains mostly void of what we&rsquo;d consider canonical modernist or postmodernist fiction. This doesn&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that modernist and postmodernist aesthetics influenced popular culture, though&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s undeniable they have. Another possibility is that these trends represent a shift in post-War American feeling or imagination. These are just some ideas I&rsquo;m throwing out there. Something interesting is clearly going on based on these trends: it will take a lot more (rigorous) study to make some more solid hypotheses.</p>

        <p>I do a lot of reading. I like to be able to keep track of it all in some way. I used to use Goodreads, but I don’t really care about the social media-y aspects of the site and it just feels overkill for what I want to do. So here&rsquo;s a plain, simple list of stuff I&rsquo;ve been reading lately. I’d like to make this a habit to keep track of my reading progress&mdash;compiling monthly reading lists. This one is short because I just had the idea last week, but hopefully I keep it up.</p>
<p>The spring semester has just started and I’m taking two seminars: one on eighteenth-century British drama, and one on modernism. So most of my reading has to do with one of those two things.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve been reading in January, or at least the week of the month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary Helen McMurran. “The New Cosmpolitanism and the Eighteenth Century.” 1/25</li>
<li>Christopher J. Wheately. “Tragedy” in <em>The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre</em>. 1/26</li>
<li>Derek Hughes. “Restoration and Settlement: 1660 and 1688” in <em>The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre</em>. 1/27</li>
<li>Marshall Berman. “Introduction” from <em>All That Is Solid Melts Into Air</em>. 1/27</li>
<li>Marshall Berman. “II. All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: Marx, Modernism and Modernization” in <em>All That Is Solid Melts Into Air</em>. 1/28</li>

        <p>Last semester I took a seminar on the materiality of early modern English books. I’m a Victorianist, but I was drawn to the course by the promise of spending lots of time in the Rare Book and Manuscript library.</p>
<p>Our main focus in the seminar was on the ways Shakespeare’s plays and early modern ballads interact: how Shakespeare’s plays rely upon, use, and remediate ballads and how ballads rely upon, use, and remediate Shakespeare’s plays. As a class, we developed our own ballad adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays in order to explore some aspect of the materiality remediation. For my project, I wrote a web app, <a href="http://balladmonger.kylerjohnston.com">Balladmonger</a>, which generates ballads based on the text of <em>King Lear</em> and its remediations&mdash;texts that influenced it or that it influenced.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of Balladmonger" src="/static/img/balladmonger-screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>My initial purpose for the project was threefold. First, <em>Balladmonger</em> literally re-mediates (puts into a new medium) words and phrases lifted directly from some other work. But can we call the texts <em>Balladmonger</em> produces a “remediation” of that work? Can we call a semi-random collection of words and phrases from <em>King Lear</em> a version of <em>King Lear</em>? It’s an ontological question about what a play or a ballad or a text is. What relation does text as such, stripped of context, have to “the text” of <em>Lear</em>?</p>
<p>I was also interested in engaging with the performative aspect of early modern plays and ballads and the performative aspect of <em>reading</em> plays and ballads. That’s why I have <em>Balladmonger</em> generate the poems dynamically each time a user visits the site, rather than archiving them to a blog or something: it’s my attempt to translate the perceived “immediacy,” “presence,” and singularity of watching and listening to a performance of a ballad or a play into a digital, web-native aesthetic object. When you navigate away from the page, the ballad is gone forever. </p>
<p>In addition to remediating performance as such, this ephemeralizing behavior also puts the reader in a powerful position that breaks down an opposition between producer and consumer: the reader controls when a new ballad will be created and when a ballad will vanish into the aether of the internet. If the reader wants to preserve a poem, it’s their responsibility to copy and paste it&mdash;and remediate it&mdash;into a Tumblr post or whatever. This calls attention not only to the power of reading as such&mdash;readers’ power to make meaning from any text&mdash;but also to the social and communal aspects of reading specific to early modern ballad transmission and production. Margaret Spufford, in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KEjQvnsbgUcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=small%20books%20and%20pleasant%20histories%20spufford&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=small%20books%20and%20pleasant%20histories%20spufford&amp;f=false"><em>Small Books and Pleasant Histories</em></a>, describes the case of the eighteenth-century ballad singer Anna Gordon who recited ballads she had learned from her aunt as a child, ballads which she “recreated afresh on each occasion she sang them. She had no concept of fidelity to one text or to one set of words; she remade her ballads afresh, changing characters, words and even rhymes and sounds, yet retaining fidelity to the story” (13). Gordon’s ballad singing practices destabilize textual authority in much the same way as <em>Balladmonger</em>. Gordon is at once a producer and consumer of texts, generating new texts with new meanings from a collage-like assemblage of older texts, new texts which can then be recombined and remediated in turn by a new set of readers. It’s a model that makes “authority,” in the sense of authorship, seem like an outmoded concept.</p>
<h2>Coding the process of remediation</h2>
<p>Writing a program to create digital poems out of digital versions of seventeenth-, eighteenth-, nineteenth, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century texts turns out to be a really effective way of to understand the material process of remedation. A program is a series of explicit instructions for actions a computer must take: the choices you make as a programmer in designing this kind of program define both the to-be-remediated object and the final post-remediation object. This is not as simple as it sounds: you can’t just tell the computer to turn <em>King Lear</em> into a poem. The computer doesn’t know what <em>King Lear</em> or plays or poems or words are: you have to define those things&mdash;and define them in terms a computer can understand, i.e. very specifically, with explicit limitations. Computers don’t do ambiguity. This same problem, the problem of defining limits, seems to be behind the difficulties many scholars, such as <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=aXX8dev1xj0C&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=studies%20in%20ephemera%20patricia%20fumerton&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Patricia Fumerton</a> and <a href="http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/3/291.abstract">Diana Kichuk</a>, have written about in regards to large-scale digital archival projects like <a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/home">Early English Books Online</a> and <a href="http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu">the English Broadside Ballad Archive</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing <em>Balladmonger</em> does is “clean” the training texts by removing things like chapter headings, running titles, page numbers, front and end matter, subtitle metadata, and speaker indicators in drama. One way to think about these things is as a kind of metadata, surplus information which helps us to make sense of but is ultimately extraneous to our data, “the text” as such. Indeed, that way of thinking has been one common (and dominant) trend in literary studies in the twentieth century, and that’s also how you have to think of those things in order to write this kind of program: I had to make <em>Balladmonger</em> discard the extraneous “stuff” in order to get at the text I want. As book historians would remind us, though, these things&mdash;chapter headings, running titles, front and end matter and the like&mdash;are all key components of the meaning-making process when a reader reads a book, shaping readers’ expectations of the text and signifying where it sits generically, geographically, socially, and politically. These components are also integrally bound to their media. Running titles and page numbers signify print, just as hyperlinks signify digital media. In effect, <em>Balladmonger</em> can only work by erasing all signifiers of previous mediation in the text, but this also effaces all of the meaning bound up with those signifiers and those media. <em>Balladmonger</em> draws its text from twenty-six sources. The generic, social, historical, and political difference of these source texts, texts which range in publication date from the seventeenth through the twenty-first centuries, if effaced; they all blend together to signify a new social, historical, political, and generic reality.</p>
<p>While <em>Balladmonger</em> masks the signs of its source texts’ previous mediations and locates itself in a new social reality, it still succeeds&mdash;I think, at least&mdash;in capturing the ephemeral qualities of early modern ballads and their coinciding decentering of authorship. Reading the ballads&mdash;both early modern and the ones produced by <em>Balladmonger</em>&mdash;is a unique interpretive task. <em>Balladmonger</em>’s ballads almost read like modernist poetry: adjacent fractured images; the gravitational significance of the randomly chosen “woodcut” image; certain lines&mdash;lines you’re familiar with, lines that will differ for each individual reader&mdash;demand you recall aspects of their former works. From all this jumbled mess the reader has to construct some sort of narrative, to make some sort of unifying sense, just as Anna Gordon made new sense out of her patchwork ballads.</p>
